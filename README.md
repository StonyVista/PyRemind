# PyRemind
A reminder program made in python.

pyRemind is currently in very early development so you should expect bugs! 
(I am aware that the main GUI is very inefficient, it's based on the calendar GUI from my old weird python virtual assistant thing (you can find that in the my-old-useless-programs repository))

For the new SVista GUI update, you will also need to install pyqt5
